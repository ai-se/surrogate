# Context
These are the constrained models which were introduced in "An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point Based Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part II: HandlingConstraints and Extending to an Adaptive Approach"

# Type1: Type-1 constrained problems, the original Pareto-optimal
front is still optimal, but there is an infeasible barrier in approaching
the Pareto-optimal front.

- C1-DTLZ1:

- C1-DTLZ3:

# Type2: Type-2 constrained
problems are designed to introduce infeasibility to a part of the
Pareto-optimal front. Such problems will test an algorithmâ€™s
ability to deal with discontinuities in the Pareto-optimal fronts.

- C2-DTLZ2:

- convex C2-DTLZ2:


# Type3: Type-3 problems involve multiple constraints and the entire
Pareto-optimal front of the unconstrained problem is
no longer optimal, rather portions of the added constraint
surfaces constitute the constrained Pareto-optimal front.
